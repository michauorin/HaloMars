# Halo Mars

This project was my assignment in High Level Programming Languages course during my Batchelors EE degree on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.

The main goal was to create a simulation engine as a form of educational aid for Control Systems course.

I was granted the permission to publish the code under GPL license, allowing for it's potential actual use in teaching.
It still is a very bare-bones tech demo, but as a proof of concept it definitely works.
The demonstrated system is the classic interview problem of controlling the engines of a descending lander and deccelerate it in a safe but efficient manner.

Control over the engines is granted via a PID system.

I guess the TODOs would be to implement a multiple selectable simulation interface, and instructions for creation of new systems simulations.
No promises on any updates in the near future (late 2020).
